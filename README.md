# Forecasting Airbnb Prices in Cambridge, Massachusetts: “Regression Analysis”

Objective: This study explores the factors influencing the pricing of Airbnb listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Through regression analysis, the project identifies key variables that significantly impact listing prices and provides insights into pricing strategies for hosts.

Methodology: The analysis uses regression models to evaluate the relationships between Airbnb pricing and various listing characteristics. Key statistical measures, including R-squared values and t-statistics, are applied to assess the significance and explanatory power of the model.

Insights: Listings with fewer minimum nights and higher numbers of reviews tend to have lower prices, reflecting affordable and accessible options.
Room type continues to be a critical determinant of price, consistent with findings from existing literature (e.g., Zervas et al., 2017).

Implications: The findings underscore the importance of listing characteristics in determining pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts. Key takeaways for hosts include:
Optimizing Room Types: Adjusting room types to align with market demand can enhance competitiveness.
Managing Reviews: Actively encouraging and maintaining guest reviews can influence pricing outcomes and booking frequency.
By leveraging these insights, hosts can adopt data-driven strategies to optimize listing performance and maximize profitability.
